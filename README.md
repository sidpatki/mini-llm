# mini-llm
- This codebase provides a basic implementation of transformer based LLM. 
- This is a character level LLM, includes lower and upper case letters and some special symbols like newline, space, fullstop etc.
- Inspired from Andrej Karpathy's video lecture. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)
